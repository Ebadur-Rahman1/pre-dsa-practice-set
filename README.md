## 🧩 **Topics Covered**

### 🟢 **Basics**

* Print statements and simple calculations
* Arithmetic operations (product, average, area of circle)
* Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
* Even or odd (multiple approaches)
* Simple calculator using switch
* Leap year check
* Largest among numbers
* Day of week using switch
* Swap two numbers (with & without third variable)

---

### 🔵 **Loops**

* Print numbers using `for` / `while` loop
* Sum and product of natural numbers
* Reverse a number
* Factorial of a number
* Multiplication table
* Keep entering numbers until a condition is met

---

### 🟣 **Functions**

* Product of two numbers using a function
* Binomial coefficient (`nCr`)
* Prime number check (optimized)
* Print primes in a range
* Prime factors of a number
* Print first N natural numbers

---

### 🟠 **Advanced Basics (Basic2)**

* Perfect number check
* Count digits / Sum of digits
* X raised to power Y
* Fibonacci series
